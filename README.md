# Network Scanning with Nmap

### Project Overview

Nmap is a scanner used for determining ports and certain characteristics on a network, such as hosts, services, and potential vulnerabilities. The goal is to gain practical experience with Nmapâ€™s scanning capabilities, analyze the results, and learn how to interpret them for cybersecurity purposes. The **Metasploitable** machine will be used for testing purposes, as it is a deliberately vulnerable machine.

---

### Approach & Tools

### Environment Setup
- Deployed a controlled test network environment using **VirtualBox**.
- Configured **Kali Linux** as the primary scanning tool.

### Tools Used
- **Kali Linux**: A penetration testing distribution with pre-installed security tools.
- **Nmap (Network Mapper)**: A powerful open-source tool for network discovery and security auditing.

### Procedure
- Identified the target systems within the test network.
- Used various Nmap scanning techniques (e.g., **ping sweep**, **SYN scan**, and **OS detection**) to gather network and host information.
- Analyzed scan results to identify **open ports**, **running services**, and **potential vulnerabilities**.

### Why Metasploitable Instead of My Home Network?

- **Ethical Considerations**: Scanning a live home network could disrupt devices or services unintentionally.
- **Safe Environment**: The test network is isolated, ensuring that no unintended data exposure occurs.
- **Customizability**: Metasploitable is deliberately vulnerable, so it reveals more vulnerabilities for targeted learning.

### Implementation & Findings

### Steps Taken
1. Launched Kali Linux and verified network connectivity to the Metasploitable VM.
2. Performed different types of scans, including:
   - **Ping Sweep**: Identified live hosts.
   - **Host Discovery Command**: Checked which hosts are up without scanning ports.
   - **Basic Port Scan**: Selected key ports to scan.
   - **Service Version Detection**: Checked versions of services.
   - **Full TCP Scan**: Scanned all TCP ports.
   - **Aggressive Scan**: Comprehensive scan of the network.
   - **SYN Scan**: Detected open ports and services.
   - **OS Detection**: Identified operating systems of targets.
3. Documented and analyzed findings from each scan.

**Metasploitable Machine IP**: `192.168.1.83`  
**Network Setup**: Both VMs used a **Bridged Adapter** to be recognized on the same network.

### Nmap Commands Used

#### Host Discovery Command
```bash
nmap -sn 192.168.1.83
```

#### Basic Port Scan
```bash
nmap -p 80,443 192.168.1.83
```

#### Service Version Detection & TCP Ports
```bash
nmap -sT -sV 192.168.1.83
```

#### Aggressive Scan
```bash
nmap -A 192.168.1.83
```

## Summary

- **Host Discovery** is used to identify the presence of assets and potential threats.
- **Basic Port Scans** reveal service exposure that could be exploited.
- **Service Version Detection** maps the services to specific vulnerabilities.
- **Full TCP Scans** provide a comprehensive view of the network's attack surface.
- **Aggressive Scans** gather detailed insights into system status.

### Key Observations
- Nmap successfully identified all live hosts in the network.
- Open ports included common services like **SSH (22)**, **HTTP (80)**, and **FTP (21)**.
- Detected **outdated versions** of services, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.
- OS detection revealed detailed system information, including probable versions.

---

### Solutions & Recommendations

### Addressing the Issues

#### Vulnerable Services
- Update outdated services to mitigate potential exploits.
- Implement firewalls to restrict unnecessary open ports.

#### Network Security
- Configure **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)** to monitor scanning activities.
- Employ **network segmentation** to limit exposure of critical systems.

> Follow up with additional scans after applying patches and deploying security tools.
